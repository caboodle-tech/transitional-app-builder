# Transitional App Builder (TAB)
Transitional App Builder, also referred to as *A* Transitional App Builder (atab), is a modern reimagining of how a framework can be used to build and manage web based projects: web applications **and** websites. This means multi-page applications (MPA), single-page applications (SPA), and progressive web applications (PWA). You should consider using TAB if:

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; Your project is primarily a static website or application.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; Your project is highly dynamic and you are conformable managing SPA or PWA on your own; or you have a tool in mind that would work well with TAB.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You want a lightweight easy to use templating framework when other tools would just be overkill or unnecessary.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You want to build a MPA/ multi-page website fast.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You want to build a SPA/ single-page website fast.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You prefer to develop in vanilla languages; HTML, CSS (less or sass), and JavaScript.

## The TAB Manifesto
TAB was created because I saw a need for a simple lightweight framework that could do three things:

1. Improve development time and morale for individuals/teams.
2. Help individuals/organizations use a better tool for a given project.
3. Encourage rising developers to learn more about languages and less about tooling.

Please read the [full manifesto](MANIFESTO.md) if you would like to know more &ndash; I have a lot to say &ndash; and visit the documentation website for a live demonstration of TAB.
