# Transitional App Builder (TAB)
Transitional App Builder, also referred to as *A* Transitional App Builder (atab), is a modern reimagining of how a compiler can be used to build and manage web based projects; web applications **and** websites. This means multi-page applications (MPA), single-page applications (SPA), and single or multiple page websites, which are often incorrectly referred to as MPA or SPA. You should consider using TAB if:

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; Your project consists mostly of a static website or application.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; Your project is highly dynamic and you are conformable managing that on your own; see next point.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You want a lightweight easy to use templating framework; when Angular, React, or Vue would just be overkill or unnecessary.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You want to build a MPA or multi-page website fast.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; You want to build a SPA or single-page website fast.

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; Your not afraid of programming and/or prefer to develop in vanilla languages; HTML, CSS (less or sass), and JavaScript.

## The TAB Manifesto
TAB was created because I saw a need for a simple lightweight framework that could do three things:

1. Increase development time and morale for individuals and teams.
2. Help people/organizations use a better tool for a given project.
3. Encourage rising developers to learn more about languages and less about tools.

Please read the full manifesto if you would like to know more and visit the documentation website for a live demonstration of TAB.
